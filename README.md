# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (C++ | Minimax Algorithm)

A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in C++ where the computer plays using the **Minimax Algorithm**, making it an **unbeatable AI opponent**. This project demonstrates concepts in **Recursion**, **Game Theory**, and **AI Decision-Making**.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **Human vs AI** Mode
- 🧮 **Minimax Algorithm** for optimal computer moves
- 🔁 **Recursive decision tree evaluation**
- 🎯 CLI-based board UI
- ❌ Draw detection & Win logic
- 🧑 Always plays as `X`, Computer as `O`

<br>

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Recursion
- Game Theory (Minimax)
- CLI / Terminal

## 🧩 How Minimax Works

The **Minimax algorithm** is used to simulate all possible future game states:
- AI assumes opponent plays optimally.
- Recursively assigns scores (+10 for win, -10 for loss, 0 for draw).
- AI always picks the move that **maximizes its score** and **minimizes opponent's chance to win**.

> This makes the AI impossible to beat.
